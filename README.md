# extractive-text-summarization

## Background
There is a virtually infinite amount of text-based data that currently exists; so much data is being generated that an individual could not possibly hope to consume it all. This text-based data is also uniquely useful to data analysts - from digesting consumer reviews on products and venues, gleaning key facts and locations from breaking news articles, to understanding what is popular and trending in an ever-changing internet landscape through social media posts. This creates an interesting point of tension: how do we filter and access this data in order to bring it to bear?
