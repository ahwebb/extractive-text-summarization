The Ellie Mae Classic in California, which is essentially an entry-level division for the much more lucrative PGA Tour, will feature Steph Curry - a basketball superstar and Under Armour icon. While both Curry and his sponsor Under Armour are very excited about this opportunity because of the chance to raise the profile of this event, the move by the tour organizers is a vanity project. The is a chartiable aspect of this arrangement that is worthy of praise, but it ends there. Golf should be accentuating its own blue-chip properties, not shipping them in from elsewhere. Golf is typically seen as a fallback career option, but players who move from one professional sport to golf often fall far short of a competitive level. Surely the more valid move is to give emerging - perhaps struggling - players a chance at a larger tournament. Regardless of his performance, scenario's like Curry's are better avoided.
