In Showtime's new series revival, David Lynch's Twin Peaks that was cancelled mid-story is back on the air. The show picks up where it left off in the 1991 season 2 finale, though many of the characters now have moved on and changed. FBI special agent and series protagonist Dale Cooper has changed as well, and we the audience have changed with him. Season 1 showed us a Cooper who was optimistic and enthusiastic - viewers wanted to be him and emulate his cheerful outlook on the world. As the story progressed it grew darker, however. By the end of season 2 we had seen Cooper be frightened and powerless, as much as we had seen him confident and in control. In this reboot we see Cooper dazed and confused, and like the audience he is navigating his way through a new world. And though decades have gone by for Cooper and for the viewers of Twin Peaks, we're still hopefully optimistic about where the show is going.
