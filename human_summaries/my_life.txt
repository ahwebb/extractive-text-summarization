The new year always prompts a cleaning frenzy, and in addition to the areas of my home that I clean regularly I also clean my appliances. Use distilled white vinegar in a dishwasher safe cup each month to prevent germs and maintain efficiency of your machine. Afterwards, use baking soda to deodorize. For your coffee maker, use equal parts vinegar and water to run through the machine and clean it of hard-water minerals. For your refrigerator, remove everything from the shelves quarterly to wipe it down and throw out any expired food. Store items in your refrigerator properly, and make sure that it's not overfilled or underfilled. Washing machines should be run with distilled white vinegar to sanitize the basin and wipe out remaining germs every month. Leave the door open so that the basin can properly dry between washes. Use lemon, salt, and ice cubes to clean your garbage disposal once a month. Finally, use a cup of water with lemon or distilled white vinegar added to clean your microwave. Microwave your solution on high for about 3 minutes, and then wipe down the windows covered in steam.
